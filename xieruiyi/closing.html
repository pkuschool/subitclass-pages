    <h1>closing examination in BJHMT 2021 winter</h1>
    <p>Your honor, opposing counsel, members of the jury, may it please the court.</p>
    <p><strong>A more possible story, a more potential suspect.</strong> </p>
    <p>Members of the jury, you've now heard the story between Taylor Mulligan and Ellie Moore. 
        Taylor Mulligan and Ellie Moore are two students studying in Elm Lake Preparatory Academy. 
        They are both very hardworking and focused on their schoolwork. In senior year, they even became the top of their class, 
        and have the chance to win the Williamson scholarship, the most prestigious award at the school. 
        Unfortunately, it all ends because of a fire.</p>
    <p>On the evening of May 18, 2020, a fire engulfed the Lewis Dormitory. 
        Ellie Moore was studying in her room when the fire started, and she failed to run out of it.
        （语气）Unfortunately, she lost her life in this fire. And Taylor Mulligan has been charged by 
        the State of Midlands with having committed the criminal offenses of 
        Aggravated Arson and First Degree Murder in connection with the death of Ellie Moore. </p>
    <p>To sustain the charge of First Degree Murder and Aggravated Arson, the prosecution must prove the following propositions:</p>
    <p>1.Mulligan is committed aggravated arson</p>
    <p>2.Mulligan intentionally damaged the school building</p>
    <p>3.When Mulligan did so, she knew Ellie was in that room/Moore died from the fire</p>
    <p>We as the defense do not have any burden to prove anything to the jury today, 
        but during today's trial, we still proved to you there is
         A more possible story, and Tristan Harris is the more potential suspect.</p>
    <p>At the beginning （往下走）of the trail（往下走）, my co-council, Jolene has asked you to look for answer to this question: （停顿）</p>
    <p><strong>Is Taylor Mulligan （停顿）the most possible suspect?</strong></p>

        <p>Through today's trial, we have shown to you that she is not.</p>
        
        <p>Members of the jury, there's clearly A more possible story, and a more potential suspect, And that person is Tristan Harris, the abusive ex of Ellie Moore.</p>
        
        <p> Let's look at the evidence:</p> 
        
        <p>    You've heard Montana Lee, the Forensic Psychologist, stated that Mulligan's intelligence level is significantly higher than she would expect of the person who started this fire; it would be highly unusual for her to be the revenge arsonist. But you've also heard, from her, that how Harris had been behaving in study, correspond to the intelligence level she would expect to see in a revenge arsonist. (stop) (slower)</p>
        <p>  You've heard, that on the day of the incident, Harris appeared at the gas station, wearing a pair of gloves in a very hot day, and bought a gas container with a gallon of gasoline from my client. You've heard from the officer that a gallon of gasoline is recovered from the scene, with my client's fingerprint，because my client was the one who loaned the tank to Tristan Harris, whose prints where never found, because he was wearing gloves. </p> 
        <p>   You've heard from not one, but multiple witnesses, that Moore has experienced an abusive relationship with Tristian Harris, her ex. You've heard from Moore's close friend Kai Adler,  that Moore's arm was often covered by the bruises Harris left. Members of the jury, you've seen the multiple threatening texts(raise exhibit) Harris sent to Moore . 
        阅读短信里一两条最extreme的</p> 
        <p>Now the prosecution might have you believe my client was competitor with Moore at school, and that is very true. But did my client ever threaten Moore? No. Did Mulligan ever spoke of “ruining Moore's life”? No. In fact, the most unfriendly (quote/fingers) thing my client said, was that Moore should study on her own, since her grades are so good.</p>
        
        <p>  You've heard, from Kai Adler (in cross examination), that she had seen the suspect with a dark SUV at the scene of the crime. You've heard from Montana Lee, that Tristan Harris had access to a dark SUV, just like the one seen by Adler.</p>   
        
         <p>   All these evidence and testimony shows that, Taylor Mulligan could not have possibly set up the fire. Tristian Harris has a bigger motive to conduct the crime, a bigger possibility to be present at the scene. and Harris setting Moore's dorm on fire is a more possible story. Tristan Harris is the more potential suspect.
        </p>
        
        
         <p>  Members of the jury, let's look back to this question:</p> 
        <p><strong>Is Taylor Mulligan the most possible suspect?</strong></p>
        
        <p>After our trail today, you should find the answer to this question to be no. Anyone given the fact that Taylor Mulligan's relationship with Ellie Moore were only classmates or competitors won't believe her as the most possible suspect. Anyone who knows how Tristian Harris's story will be more likely to believe that this is the more possible story, a more potential suspect. And your answers today point to the fact that my client is not the one who set the fire, is not the one who took the life of  Ellie Moore. 
        </p>
        <p>Members of the jury, today you've seen a teenager, who works hard to receive good grades, who has determination to be accepted in his dream school, who deserves a bright future. Taylor Mulligan's future shouldn't be blocked for a crime that she did not commit to do. 
        </p>
        <p>Members of the jury, please remember that, there is a more possible story, and Tristan Harris is the more potential suspect.
        </p>
        <p>And in that case, Please find Taylor Mulligan not guilty of First Degree Murder and Aggravated Arson, thank you.
